# Research-Project
This contains all custom script generated in RStudio for my Undergraduate Genetics Research Project. 

### 'EarlGrey' Transposable Element Annotation
This script takes the gff output of the repeat annotation pipeline 'EarlGrey', and annotates repeat content across genomic bins of 100 kb. 
EarlGrey is available at: https://github.com/TobyBaril/EarlGrey

### 'AUGUSTUS' gene annotation
This script takes the gff output of the AUGUSTUS gene prediciton programme, and annotates gene content across genomic bins of 100 kb. 

### Divergence of Repeats
This script takes and plots the estimations of K2P distance of repeat elements. 

### Locating Repeats in Gene Regions 
This script determines where repeats lie within genomic regions.
