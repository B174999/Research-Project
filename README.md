This contains all custom script generated in RStudio for my Undergraduate Genetics Research Project. 

### 'EarlGrey' Transposable Element Annotation

EarlGrey is available at: https://github.com/TobyBaril/EarlGrey
This script also includes the estimates for GC content 

### 'AUGUSTUS' gene annotation
